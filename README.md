This is Zhao Chai, an undergraduate majored in computer science and mathmatics in Northeastern. I have done two co-ops. The first one was in ArrowStreet Capital working as a software developer. The second one was in IBM research center, which was located in Beijing China, and I worked there as an industrial solution analyst.
The purpose for this repository is for the web developemt course, where I put all my source code for my personal project and all the assignments.
